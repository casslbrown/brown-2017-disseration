Abstract = {{The objective of the present study was to examine relations between
   social network size and three cognitive abilities (episodic memory,
   semantic memory, visuospatial ability) in middle-aged adults. We
   analyzed cross-sectional data on social network size and cognitive
   functioning that were available for 804 participants aged 40-60 years.
   In addition, we examined 5- and 10-year follow-up measurements of
   cognitive functioning that were available for 604 and 255 participants,
   respectively. Cross-sectional analyses revealed a positive association
   between social network size and each of the three cognitive abilities.
   Baseline network size was positively related to 5-year changes in
   semantic memory, and to 10-year changes in semantic as well as episodic
   memory, but was unrelated to changes in visuospatial performance. A
   minor portion of the sample (n = 131) had 10-year follow-up data on
   network size. Cross-lagged panel correlations revealed that baseline
   network size was associated with follow-up measurement in cognitive
   functioning (episodic memory, semantic memory), whereas baseline
   cognitive performance was unrelated to future network size. Together,
   the results demonstrate a small but positive relation between network
   size and declarative memory abilities, in line with models proposing a
   cognitive reserve built up by factors such as the increased cognitive
   stimulation associated with a more extensive social network.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Scant evidence is available on the discordance between
   loneliness and social isolation among older adults. We aimed to
   investigate this discordance and any health implications that it may
   have.
   Method: Using nationally representative datasets from ageing cohorts in
   Ireland (TILDA) and England (ELSA), we created a metric of discordance
   between loneliness and social isolation, to which we refer as Social
   Asymmetry. This metric was the categorised difference between
   standardised scores on a scale of loneliness and a scale of social
   isolation, giving categories of: Concordantly Lonely and Isolated,
   Discordant: Robust to Loneliness, or Discordant: Susceptible to
   Loneliness. We used regression and multilevel modelling to identify
   potential relationships between Social Asymmetry and cognitive outcomes.
   Results: Social Asymmetry predicted cognitive outcomes cross-sectionally
   and at a two-year follow-up, such that Discordant: Robust to Loneliness
   individuals were superior performers, but we failed to find evidence for
   Social Asymmetry as a predictor of cognitive trajectory over time.
   Conclusions: We present a new metric and preliminary evidence of a
   relationship with clinical outcomes. Further research validating this
   metric in different populations, and evaluating its relationship with
   other outcomes, is warranted. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons,

Title = {Social support mediates the relationships between extraversion,
   neuroticism, and cognitive function in older adults},
Journal = {Public Health},

Volume = {147},
Pages = {144-152},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {{Objectives: We supplement existing findings on a link between social
   support and cognitive function in later life by considering the role of
   personality as an antecedent to both, and of social support as a
   mediator of the link between personality and cognitive function.
   Study design: An observational cohort study.
   Methods: We evaluated social support using the Lubben Social Network
   Scale, across 624 adults aged over 60 years, and investigated this
   measure as a mediator of the relationships between extraversion and
   neuroticism at baseline 2007-2009, and cognitive function at follow-up,
   2 years later. A half-longitudinal mediation design, within a structural
   equation modelling framework, was used.
   Results: There was a direct effect of extraversion, such that lower
   levels were related to higher scores of cognitive function. There was no
   significant direct effect of neuroticism on cognitive function at
   follow-up. Social support partially mediated the paths between both
   extraversion and neuroticism and cognitive function at follow-up.
   Decomposing the mediation effects by using social support subscales
   (measuring support from friends, relatives and neighbours) showed
   meaningful indirect effects for both predictors.
   Conclusion: Results suggest that social support may offer a target for
   interventions for cognitively at-risk older adults and add to the
   existing empirical evidence describing the link between personality and
   cognitive function. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd

Abstract = {{Social networks change with age and may affect physical and mental
   health outcomes. Few studies have examined the influence of cognitive
   functioning and depressive symptoms on social network sizes among older
   adults. This study examined the impact of cognition and depression on
   the social networks of 79 community dwelling elderly. Social network
   sizes were measured using Antonucci's Convoy method. Consistent with
   predictions, participants with lower cognitive functioning scores had
   fewer outer circle social contacts. Higher depressive symptomatology was
   associated with smaller numbers of close, inner circle relationships.
   These results suggest potentially greater network changes in older
   adults experiencing depressive symptomatology or cognitive decline,
   albeit in different aspects of the social network (close vs. peripheral
   relationships). Possessing fewer emotionally rewarding close
   relationships may be particularly difficult for elderly individuals
   relying on emotional and instrumental support. These findings also imply
   that poorer cognitive functioning may accelerate the reduction of outer
   circle networks.}},
